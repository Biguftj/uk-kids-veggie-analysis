# uk-kids-veggie-analysis

A behavioral data project exploring how framing vegetables as superpowers could influence UK children's healthy eating habits — and whether those habits stick through life.

---

## Project Summary

The goal of this project is to investigate:
- How much fruit and vegetable intake UK children get
- Whether early healthy eating habits persist into adolescence and adulthood
- How a behavioral intervention (like presenting vegetables as "superpowers") could improve these habits

We use data from the **National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS)**, Years 12–15 (2019 to 2023).
