# UK Kids' Vegetable Habits: Do They Stick Into Adulthood?

This project explores UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) data (2019–2023) to understand whether **eating vegetables as a child** leads to **healthier eating habits later in life**.

## Key Question

> Do children who consume vegetables early in life maintain that habit as they grow into adults?

## Summary of Findings

- Only **9% of children aged 11–18** meet the “5 A Day” guideline.
- Adult intake averages **3.3–3.7 portions per day**, still well below target.
- Vegetarianism is rare: **<3%** across all age groups.
- **Healthy habits do not strongly persist** into adulthood — public health interventions are needed.
